<p>This is my recipe website that I have created in the hopes of helping individuals my age get more into cooking. After doing some research college age individuals do not cook at home as much as they eat out. As a result college students are spending more money on food. If a college kid was able to go into a grocery store and pick out ingredients for a recipe that they would make that night, they would be able to spend roughly 60 dollars a week on food. Compared too spending around 100 dollars in 5 days on food from restaurants and delivery services. The reason for mentioning delivery services is that many times college age students are getting the food that they orderd from a restaurant delivered to their door. This adds on average of 5 dollars per food order due to delivery fees and tips. Students can fix this problem by cooking themselves at home. Below are some dishes that I have made at my house while living in college. </p>
